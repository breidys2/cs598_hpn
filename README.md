To develop/run this, we reused the VM from https://github.com/p4lang/tutorials

Therefore to run, follow the instructions for booting their vm.

Then for each simple (01-Turing Maching) and complex (01-incrementing-Turing Machine):
* Copy the the .p4 and .py file into the exercises/calc directory.

* Rename them to calc.p4 and calc.py

* make

* h1 python3 calc.py

* send

The resulting tape will be printed from the response packet.
